Demo project showcasing blockchain with Haskell

## Resources

    - [Introduction to cryptocurrencies in Haskell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjyiOXRuUdo)
    - [Nanocoin](https://github.com/adjoint-io/nanocoin)
    - [Rolling your own blockchain in Haskell](https://functional.works-hub.com/learn/Rolling-your-Own-Blockchain-in-Haskell)


## TODO

    - When computing the merkle tree better use
      [`Data.Sequence`](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.6.0.1/docs/Data-Sequence.html)
      instead of lists, just because it seems to be faster.
